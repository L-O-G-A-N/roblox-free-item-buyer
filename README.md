
Hi,

To install the required packages, please run the command `pip install -r requirements.txt`. This will install all the necessary packages listed in the file.

If you want to access packages/characters, you can open the `PACKAGES ONLY.py` file.

In the `ALMOST EVERY TYPE OF ITEM.py` file, when entering the categories, make sure to input the corresponding number, as it is required for proper functionality.
